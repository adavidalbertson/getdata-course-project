#Variables
These variables were obtained from the original UCI HAR dataset. The tidy dataset includes the standard deviation and mean for each variable, denoted by the .std and .mean suffixes on the column names, respectively. The column names also indicate the axis of measurement with a .X, .Y, or .Z suffix where applicable. Finally, each entry is the mean for each subject and activity.
('-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.)

The set of variables that were estimated from these signals are: 

mean(): Mean value
std(): Standard deviation

The complete list of variables of each feature vector is available in 'features.txt'. For a description of the original data set, see the documentation for that data set.
